# My First Node.js Web Server

This is a basic web server created with Node.js, following the ["Your First Node.js Web Server"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShtPwEkDD0) tutorial by Web Dev Simplified.

## Description

This is a simple web server that serves HTML files. The project demonstrates the basic concepts of:
- Creating an HTTP server with Node.js
- Handling file requests
- Serving HTML content
- Basic error handling

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed
3. No additional dependencies are required as we only use Node.js built-in modules

## Usage

1. Create an `index.html` file in the project root directory
2. Run the server with:
```bash
node app.js
```
3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure

- `app.js` - The main server file
- `index.html` - The HTML file to be served (you need to create it)

## Features

- Basic HTTP server on port 3000
